<p> <style="font-size:170%;"> Number 30 - <u>ROAR!</u> - From Katy Perry</p>
<p> <style="font-size:170%;"> This isn't the first time we'll be seeing Katy Perry. This song is about an eye of the tiger! It has a cool beat and the lyrics are well thought out!</p>

<p> <style="font-size:170%;"> Number 29 - <u>What about us!</u> - From Pink</p>
<p> <style="font-size:170%;"> How about the first emotional song. This is quite a long song and this never gets boring and the lyrics are so emotional, its amazing!</p>

<p> <style="font-size:170%;"> Number 28 - <u>Locked away</u> - By R City + Adam Levine</p>
<p> <style="font-size:170%;"> One of my favourites Raps (Not my favourite), I just really love singing to the great beat of the chorus. The pitch of of the voice in the chorus is amazing!</p>

<p> <style="font-size:170%;"> Number 27 - <u>let it go</u> - By Idina Menzel </p>
<p> <style="font-size:170%;"> OKOKOKOKKKKK!!! Before all the negativity comments I just want to say this song is really good... Why do you think it's so popular... Because it's good and I enjoyed it, we enjoyed this song as much as we liked it in the movie. Let's start being more positive this song!</p>
